<h1 class="blog-detail-title">Autonomous AI agents</h1>
<p><b>AI is more than just chatbots!</b> AI agents can independently handle obstacles, make decisions, and adapt </br> -just like humans do.</p>

<p>On this website, I’m introducing `Turing Tactics`, named after Alan Turing and his famous test. The slogan is: <b>`Autonomous AI agents for dynamic environments`</b>.</p>

<p>But what does that mean exactly? Think of:</p>

<li>A robot vacuum that comes up with a new route when you threw your sports bag in the corner again;</li>
<li>A webshop that gives real-time, personalized product recommendations based on your shopping cart;</li>
<li>A video game with smart teammates, opponents, and NPCs that adapt to your playing style or level.</li>
<p></p>
<p>In all of these examples, the AI agent <b>operates independently in a dynamically changing environment</b>. This is made possible by reinforcement learning, which is learning through rewards and penalties -just like we do as humans!</p>

<p>I’ve been fascinated by this technology for years. With a background in psychology and neuroscience, I started by studying human behavior and decision-making. Later, I shifted into a technical career, working as a data and cloud engineer, and AI scientist. I love that in Turing Tactics, everything comes together.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve noticed: Big Tech is leading the way in applying this technology. All social media algorithms, and the latest version of ChatGPT, rely heavily on reinforcement learning. But there’s <b>huge untapped potential</b> for smaller companies to benefit as well, from efficiency gains and increased value to better user experiences.</p>

<p>Turing Tactics offers:
<li><b>Brainstorming sessions</b> and strategic advice</li>
<li><b>Custom AI agents</b>, with low-barrier proof of concept projects that can scale based on results</li>
<li><b>Workshops</b> for technical teams to learn how to design, develop, and improve AI agents themselves</li>
</p>
<p>Curious about <b>what autonomous AI agents could do for your organization</b>? Let’s talk over coffee. Send me a message!</p>

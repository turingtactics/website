<h1 class="blog-detail-title">Reinforcement learning</h1>
<p>Reinforcement learning is at the root of some of the most advanced technologies today, such as self-driving
                cars, social media algorithms, and AI opponents in gaming. As a psychologist and neuroscientist, I am
                especially fascinated by it, as its learning mechanism is most similar to human learning. Whereas other
                algorithms learn by finding patterns in known input and output pairs, reinforcement learning is done by an
                agent who learns in a dynamic environment. Whereas other algorithms estimate the right “answer”, an RL agent
                learns the best “decision”.</p>
<p>It’s time for an example; take the game of Tag. There are two players, the tagger and the runner. When they
                end up in the same spot, it’s a “tag”, and the tagger wins the round. Then, the roles are reversed. Instead
                of two human players on a playground, two AI agents play a digital game of tag. When the tagger and runner
                agents are close together, and the tagger decides to move in such a way that it leads to a tag, it gets a
                large reward of, let’s say, +51 points. The runner gets a punishment of -51 points. Each move the tagger
                makes without a tag, is -1 point. Each move the runner makes without a tag, is +1 point. An agent starts
                exploring the environment, making only random decisions. However, after each game, it learns the patterns
                between state, action and reward. Through this process, its moves get better. The algorithm gets tuned to
                predict what to do in the environment to get the highest possible rewards and win the game of Tag.</p>
<p>So, what is reinforcement learning again? It is a process of training autonomous AI agents in dynamic
                environments, to make the best decisions! In a business context, this can be implemented on a large scale,
                such as done by Big Tech or robotics, but it can also be integrated on a small scale in existing business
                processes. Think of processes that are simple, but too complex for template-based automation. And the cool
                thing is… the AI agent can start adding value soon with these simple tasks, and keep growing and learning
                iteratively along with your organisation. Not just by learning to do the task better, but also by doing more
                and more complex decision-making.</p>
<h1 class="blog-detail-title">Applied reinforcement learning</h1>
<h2>Case 1 - Gaming agents.</h2>
<p>To give an impression, I’ll list the first 10 games that have been won with reinforcement learning algorithms: Backgammon (1992), checkers (1994), RoboCup Soccer Simulation (2003), Atari Games from the ‘80s (2013), GO (2016), Dota 2 (2018), StarCraft II (2019), Gran Turismo Sport (2021), Minecraft (2022) and Diplomacy (2022). In the last three years, many more games were introduced autonomous AI opponents trained by reinforcement learning techniques. That begs the question: why are reinforcement learning techniques not used more widespread in live playing mode. For example, multiplayer games that offer AI opponents are currently mostly built on rule-based and template-based methods. I see this as a great opportunity for reinforcement learning to be introduced to gaming: live autonomous AI opponents playing in a human-like fashion. By implementing the most cutting-edge techniques, multiple agents can go their own learning tracts to develop their own strategies and thereby “personalities” and skill-level. I believe this can greatly improve the players gaming experience.</p>
<h2>Case 2 - Recommendation systems.</h2>
<p>To give an impression again, in 1998 the founding algorithm of reinforcement learning, the Markov Decision Process, was used by Google to rank web pages in the Google search application. Since then, reinforcement learning has been used for recommendations for web (2001), news (2005), and personalized items in webshops (2018). Reinforcement learning is at the root of all social media technology. Autonomous AI agents do “Feed Ranking” on  YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, Bluesky, and the list goes on. I envision that these same algorithms can be brought much closer to you and me, by implementing them on a small scale. Does your website or application include content recommendations? An autonomous AI agent can do the job. </p>
<h2>Case 3 - Robotics.</h2>
<p>The first thing we imagine talking about “autonomous AI agents”, is a robot who can walk and talk on its own. Then, we think of autonomous cars, of autonomous drones. The most advanced autonomous algorithms sort our trash and are used in manufacturing and logistics. In these contexts, physical moving “limbs” and vehicles have to be responsive to our real-life, complex and chaotic, environment. Reinforcement learning can be used in this context to make live autonomous decisions.</p>
<h2>Case 4 - Process optimisation.</h2>
<p>In many industries, complex decision-making problems can’t be solved efficiently with traditional rule-based methods. This is where reinforcement learning (RL) shines. Think about the famous example, the 2016 AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol match. During the game, AlphaGo made a move so unusual that even top experts thought it was a mistake. But as the game progressed, that move turned out to be a masterstroke, a strategy no human had considered.  In the same way, RL can uncover non-obvious solutions to tough optimisation challenges, learning from trial and error to achieve better outcomes over time. Some powerful applications include the following. Energy bill optimisation: dynamically reducing costs based on usage patterns and pricing. Logistics optimisation: finding the most efficient delivery routes and schedules. Resource planning optimisation: improving allocation of time, staff, and materials. Production and process optimisation: adapting workflows in real time for better efficiency. Operations optimisation: coordinating multiple systems to reduce delays and waste. Reinforcement learning doesn’t just follow rules, it learns to outsmart them, just like AlphaGo did.  </p>

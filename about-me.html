            <h2>What drives me?</h2>
            <p>How do we think? What draws our attention? What do we believe and why? With a strong interest in the human mind and cognition, I started studying psychology, and later neuroscience. After a while, I understood a lot more about human learning, but I also learned how much we do not understand yet.</p>

            <p>Then, I was ready to get my hands dirty and create value in the "real" world. I found out that I love programming, and that data science was a way for me to contribute my skills to the labor market. There I discovered the wondrous world of data engineering and machine learning. The day I got introduced to reinforcement learning, now about 7 years ago, I felt the same fascination I knew from human decision-making. I learned to implement the deep q learning algorithm, and its innovations based on scientific discoveries. </p>

            <p>It’s super nerdy, but I can say I am passionate about this technology. I’d love to introduce it more to the world. I see that a lot of my friends feel like the AI revolution happens to them. I would love to provide more transparency about how these algorithms work, and think along with organisations how it can add value for them.</p>

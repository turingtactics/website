            <h2>What drives me?</h2>
            <p>With a strong interest in the human mind and cognition (How do we think? What draws our attention? What do we believe and why?) I started studying psychology, and later neuroscience. After a while, with a lot more understanding but even more questions, I was ready to get my hands dirty and create value in the "real" world. I found out that I love programming, and that data science was a way for me to contribute my skills to the labor market. There I discovered that data engineering is actually fascinating (and not as boring as it sounds;) and that machine learning (reinforcement learning specifically) is a lot like human learning, but more practical and less messy. As an Artificial Intelligence Scientist, I work to create value from data, and to develop algorithms for innovative tools and existing applications. It is awesome that my fascination for minds (human and artificial), my addiction to fixing bugs and how much I enjoy strategic thinking, come together in building deep reinforcement learning algorithms for applied cases. </p>

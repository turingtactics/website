            <h2>Case 1 - Small scale autonomous decisions for strategy games.</h2>
            <p>To give an impression, I’ll list the first 10 games that have been won with reinforcement learning algorithms: Backgammon (1992), checkers (1994), RoboCup Soccer Simulation (2003), Atari Games from the ‘80s (2013), GO (2016), Dota 2 (2018), StarCraft II (2019), Gran Turismo Sport (2021), Minecraft (2022) and Diplomacy (2022). In the last three years, many more games were introduced autonomous AI opponents trained by reinforcement learning techniques. That begs the question: why are reinforcement learning techniques not used more widespread in live playing mode. For example, multiplayer games that offer AI opponents are currently mostly built on template-based methods. I see this as a great opportunity for reinforcement learning to be introduced to gaming: live autonomous AI opponents. By implementing the most cutting-edge techniques, multiple agents can go their own learning tracts to develop their own strategies and thereby “personalities”. I believe this can greatly improve the players gaming experience.</p>

            <h2>Case 2 - Recommendation systems for applications.</h2>
            <p>To give an impression again, in 1998 the founding algorithm of reinforcement learning, the Markov Decision Process, was used by Google to rank web pages in the Google search application. Since then, reinforcement learning has been used for recommendations for web (2001), news (2005), and personalized items in webshops (2018). Reinforcement learning is at the root of all social media technology. Autonomous AI agents do “Feed Ranking” on  YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, Bluesky, and the list goes on. I envision that these same algorithms can be brought much closer to you and me, by implementing them on a small scale. Does your website or application include content recommendations? An autonomous AI agent can do the job. </p>

            <h2>Case 3</h2>
            <p>The first thing we imagine talking about “autonomous AI agents”, is a robot who can walk and talk on its own. Then, we think of autonomous cars, of autonomous drones. The most advanced autonomous algorithms sort our trash and are used in manufacturing and logistics. In these contexts, physical moving “limbs” and vehicles have to be responsive to our real-life, complex and chaotic, environment. Reinforcement learning can be used in this context to make live autonomous decisions. Also on a very small scale, such as an agent controlling your heating and smart house appliances. It can take into account weather patterns, energy prices and electricity net loading for optimal energy savings.  </p>

        <h1>What is reinforcement Learning?</h1>
        <p>In short, it is human-like learning for human-like decision-making.</p>

            <p>Reinforcement learning is at the root of some of the most advanced technologies today, such as self-driving cars, social media algorithms, and AI opponents in gaming. As a psychologist and neuroscientist, I am especially fascinated by it, as its learning mechanism is most similar to human learning. Whereas other algorithms learn by finding patterns in known input and output pairs, reinforcement learning is done by an agent who learns in a dynamic environment. Whereas other algorithms estimate the right “answer”, an RL agent learns the best “decision”.</p>

            <p>It’s time for an example; take the game of Tag. There are two players, the tagger and the runner. When they end up in the same spot, it’s a “tag”, and the tagger wins the round. Then, the roles are reversed. Instead of two human players on a playground, two AI agents play a digital game of tag. When the tagger and runner agents are close together, and the tagger decides to move in such a way that it leads to a tag, it gets a large reward of, let’s say, +51 points. The runner gets a punishment of -51 points. Each move the tagger makes without a tag, is -1 point. Each move the runner makes without a tag, is +1 point. An agent starts exploring the environment, making only random decisions. However, after each game, it learns the patterns between state, action and reward. Through this process, its moves get better. The algorithm gets tuned to predict what to do in the environment to get the highest possible rewards and win the game of Tag.</p>

            <p>So, what is reinforcement learning again? It is a process of training autonomous AI agents in dynamic environments, to make the best decisions! In a business context, this can be implemented on a large scale, such as done by Big Tech or robotics, but it can also be integrated on a small scale in existing business processes. Think of processes that are simple, but too complex for template-based automation. And the cool thing is… the AI agent can start adding value soon with these simple tasks, and keep growing and learning iteratively along with your organisation. Not just by learning to do the task better, but also by doing more and more complex decision-making.</p>
